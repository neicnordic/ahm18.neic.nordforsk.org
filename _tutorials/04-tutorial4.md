- Relationships are powerful. How do we create trust among colleagues and empower others for the purpose of shared leadership?

Our one-to-one connections with each other are the foundation for change. And building relationships with people from different cultures, *often many different cultures*, is key in building diverse communities that are powerful enough to achieve significant goals.

In order to work with people from different cultural groups effectively, you will need to build sturdy and caring *relationships based on trust, understanding, and shared goals.*

- How do we include diverse groups in the work of our organization, and work more effectively with people of different cultures?

Why? Because trusting relationships are the glue that hold people together as they work on a common problem. As people work on challenging problems, they will have to hang in there together when things get hard. They will have to support each other to stay with an effort, even when it feels discouraging. People will have to resist the efforts of those who use divide-and-conquer techniques -- pitting one cultural group against another.
Regardless of our racial, ethnic, religious, or socioeconomic group, we will probably need to establish relationships with people who we know very little about.

- Why is it crucial to intentionally involve others in the work, and engage them in ways that keep them involved over time?

Each one of us is like a hub of a wheel. Each one of us can build relationships and friendships around ourselves that provide us with the necessary strength to achieve community goals. If each person builds a network of diverse and strong relationships, we can come together and solve problems that we have in common.
