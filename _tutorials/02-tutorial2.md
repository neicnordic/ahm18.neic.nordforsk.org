title: Natural language processing of NeIC Slack logs in a Jupyter notebook
details: /tutorials/details2/
---

Have you ever wondered what words and phrases are used the most across all NeIC Slack channels? Or are you curious to know at which time of the day the average NeIC team member in Norway posts his/her first message to #random? Or how that compares to other Nordic countries, and whether it's correlated with average coffee consumption in these countries?
If so, join this interactive, hands-on tutorial filled with data analysis, natural language processing and pretty visualizations. All work 
will be done inside a Jupyter Notebook, so some valuable lessons in using this tool are guaranteed. 

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. In order to participate in the workshop, you will need to install Jupyter Notebooks on your laptop. 
We will use Python for our analysis so previous experience with Python is useful, but not required.
The simplest way to install Python and Jupyter is through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (follow these links for downloads and installation instructions). The material has been prepared with Python 2.7.14, but Python 3 should also work.
The following packages are required (many of which are shipped with Anaconda): `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `textmining`, `lda` and `emoji`. These can be installed with 
`conda install <package-name>` or `pip install <package-name>`.
