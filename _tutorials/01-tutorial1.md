Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Linux (HTCondor is a plus for the HPC part), own laptop with ssh access (Install Putty for windows).

Linux containers, with the build-once-run-anywhere approach, are becoming popular among scientific communities for software packaging and sharing. Docker is the most popular and user friendly platform for running and managing Linux containers. HTCondor is a High-Throughput computing cluster that is very easy to install and use on both Linux and Windows (one may have Linux and Windows compute nodes on the same cluster). HTCondor supports Docker jobs.


This workshop is a hands-on tutorial that is organized as follows:

- Overview of the Linux containers technology
- Docker: building and running Docker containers
- Containers for HPC: using Docker containers in HPC job scripts with HTCondor
