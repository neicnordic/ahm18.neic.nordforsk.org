## Dellingr Project Flash Talk Song <a name="dellingr"></a>
Melody: My Bonnie<br/>
Text: John White<br/>

Dellingr proposes a Nordic,<br/>
HPC resource sharing framework.<br/>
A set of e-infrastructure policies,<br/>
common processes and associated framework.<br/>
Fe-de-rated A-A-A,<br/>
harmonizing procedures <br/>
in compliance with national rules. (and regulations.)<br/>
Sharing of application expertise<br/>
for advanced user support.<br/>
Not intended, to change <br/>
the processes by which the national, providers manage<br/>
allocate or otherwise support<br/>
the national research priorities.<br/>
Final result<br/>
will be an equitable and fair process<br/>
for sharing and exchanging access<br/>
to resources across the Nordics.


## What shall we do with the resource sharing<a name="resource"></a>

What shall we do with the resource sharing? <br/>
What shall we do with the resource sharing? <br/>
What shall we do with the resource sharing? <br/>
in between the nordics<br/>

And what about the VAT<br/>
And what about the VAT<br/>
And what about the VAT<br/>
in between the nordics<br/>


Put him in the longboat til he s sober... 

Pull out the plug and wet him all over... 

Put him in the scuppers with a hose-pipe on him... 

Heave him by the leg in a running bowline.. 

Shave his head with a rusty razor... 

Put him in the bed with the captains daughter...
