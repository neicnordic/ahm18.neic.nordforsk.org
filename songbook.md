Melody: My Bonnie

Dellingr proposes a Nordic,<br/>
HPC resource sharing framework.<br/>
A set of e-infrastructure policies,<br/>
common processes and associated framework.<br/>
Fe-de-rated A-A-A,<br/>
harmonizing procedures <br/>
in compliance with national rules. (and regulations.)<br/>
Sharing of application expertise<br/>
for advanced user support.<br/>
Not intended, to change <br/>
the processes by which the national, providers manage<br/>
allocate or otherwise support<br/>
the national research priorities.<br/>
Final result<br/>
will be an equitable and fair process<br/>
for sharing and exchanging access<br/>
to resources across the Nordics.
