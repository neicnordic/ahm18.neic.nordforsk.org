## Dellingr Project Flash Talk Song <a name="dellingr"></a>
Melody: My Bonnie<br/>
Text: John White<br/>

Dellingr proposes a Nordic, <br/>
HPC resource sharing framework. <br/>
A set of e-infrastructure policies, <br/>
(c)ommon proc-es-ses (and) ass-ocia-ted framework.<br/>

Fe-de-rated A-A-A,<br/>
harmonizing procedures <br/>
in compliance with national rules. (and regulations.)<br/>
Sharing of application expertise<br/>

for advanced user support.<br/>
Not intended, to change <br/>
the processes by which the national, providers manage<br/>
allocate or otherwise support<br/>
the national research priorities.<br/>

Final result<br/>
will be an equitable and fair process<br/>
for sharing and exchanging access<br/>
to resources across the Nordics.


## What shall we do with the resource sharing<a name="resource"></a>

What shall we do with the resource sharing? <br/>
What shall we do with the resource sharing? <br/>
What shall we do with the resource sharing? <br/>
in between the nordics<br/>

And what about the VAT<br/>
And what about the VAT<br/>
And what about the VAT<br/>
in between the nordics<br/>

What shall we do with the GDPR? ... <br/>
and the etics consents.<br/>

What shall we do with the research data ... <br/>
in between the nordics<br/>

Put it on a paper and throw away it ... <br/>
in the big round archive <br/>

What shall we do with the threaded channel?...<br/> 
in the bloody slack team 

## <a name="mountain"></a>
Melody: Coming 'Round the Mountain

She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes
She'll be coming round the mountain
She'll be coming round the mountain
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes
