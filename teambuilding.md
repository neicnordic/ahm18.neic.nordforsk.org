### Time and place
Wednesday 17:00-19:00 in the hotel pub area downstairs. The pub will be open, so if you want you can buy softdrinks or any other drink you prefer, in addition to snacks. 

### Overall Goals
The overall goal of this teambuilding session is to have fun and link up with others. Where "others" preferrably are people you don't usually work with. 

### Format
Quiz tournament using "Speedquizzing", see videos of the format here: [http://www.speedquizzing.com/](http://www.speedquizzing.com/). <br>
Each team will have to use one smartphone for joining the quiz. Download the app from you app-store to prepare. Search for "speedquizzing". <br>

We will put together teams mixing projects as much as possible. Which team you are inn will be announced closer to the day. 


### Contributing
We enourage all that have good quiz-questions to contribute! As a thanks for the contribution you are allowed to answer your own quiz-question :). Please drop us a message on #ahm-social, or send us an email (do not post the question on the slack-channel! :) )

Type of questions:
* Multiple choice (2 minimum, 6 maximum)
* A question where the answer is a single word or a name, so that the first letter of the answer can be used to identify the correct answer. Also the question must be unambiguous. Example. Not: "Ehere can you find the Eifelltower" - which could be e.g. Paris, or France, so letters P or F. Rather: "In which town can you find the Eifelltower", where correct answer is certainly P.
* A number, e.g. a year or any other numerical answer. 
* A number where the closest answer wins, where the teams will typically guess the answer.
