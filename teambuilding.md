### Contributing
We enourage all that have good quiz-questions to contribute! As a thanks for the contribution you are allowed to answer your own quiz-question :). <br>
Tell us on #ahm-social that you have a question, then we contact you to keep it all secret (do not post the question on the slack-channel! :) ) ! 

Type of questions:
* Multiple choice (2 minimum, 6 maximum)
* A question where the answer is a single word or a name, so that the first letter of the answer can be used to identify the correct answer. Also the question must be unambiguous. Example. Not: "Ehere can you find the Eifelltower" - which could be e.g. Paris, or France, so letters P or F. Rather: "In which town can you find the Eifelltower", where correct answer is certainly P.
* A number, e.g. a year or any other numerical answer. 
* A number where the closest answer wins, where the teams will typically guess the answer.
