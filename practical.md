### Public transportation in case you need to leave earlier
Bus 211 leaves 4 times a day and takes one hour down to Lillehammer
train station (9:40, 11:40, 15:40, and 16:40).

From Lillehammer the trains to Oslo Airport are about once every hour
and take about 1 hour and 45 mins.


### Intended participants
The intended participants of the AHM are personnel contracted in the larger NeIC
operations or projects such as NT1, Glenna, Tryggve, CodeRefinery and Dellingr. 
If you are engaged in a NeIC project and not sure whether you should participate, 
please contact your team leader.  The program will include a major component of social 
networking, attempting to mitigate the effects of the completely distributed nature of 
NeIC and facilitate excellent working relations.


### Other participants
Interested members of project steering groups or reference group and
stakeholder fora who want to participate in the discussions, socialize with
NeIC and see what work in NeIC is like on the inside are warmly welcome to join
the AHM. However, co-locating official meetings in such groups to this event is
strongly discouraged, in order not to distract staff away from the prioritized
content. On the other hand, network connectivity has proven excellent at this
location, so for any sessions that do not directly concern such delegates, time
can still very likely be usefully spent doing other productive work.

### Family policy
The focus of the all hands meeting should be on spending social time together
with your teammates and therefore we do in general not recommend to bring your
family during the meeting. If you want to explore the location with your family
you’re welcome to do so, but preferably before or after the AHM. NeIC, however,
will not arrange any travel or accommodation for that.

### NeIC Slack channels for the all-hands meeting

ahm-social for more informal sharing, e.g photographs and such.
