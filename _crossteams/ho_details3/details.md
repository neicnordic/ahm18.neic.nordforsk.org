<h3> Deploying your scientific workflow in the cloud</h3>

<h4>Goals</h4>

The goal of this session is to present recent developments in provision and consumption of cloud services in Nordic countries. Examples will be presented from the NeIC projects Glenna2 (https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Glenna2) and DeepDive (https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Biodiversity). The session will include an introduction to cloud-based research infrastructure, presentation of examples and live demonstrations of cloud services, followed by a discussion of potential collaborations across NeIC projects.

<h4>Practical information</h4>

- Requirements: If you’re interested to discuss how biodiversity services are federated on the cloud you can sign up on the following platforms prior to the meeting (www.biodiversitycatalogue.org/, https://portal.biovel.eu/)



<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>

Attendees will be able to

· understand the opportunities and challenges related to the use of cloud services

· discuss how cloud services can be used in their own scientific field

· identify potential added value that can be obtained through use of cloud services across different NeIC programs
