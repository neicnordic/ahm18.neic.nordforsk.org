Glenna 2 will show how to use data.deic.dk cloud service to deploy a data intensive scientific workflow. 

DeepDive project has adopted a different approach using Amazon services and Taverna workflows (compatible with Kepler, Galaxy and R-based workflows).

And you? Have you ever used cloud services and deployed scientific workflows? 

It is still time to join our hands-on/show me your tool cross-team session!
