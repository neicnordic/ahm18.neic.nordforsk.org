All NeIC projects need to organize both their internal and external communication. Some of us use tools such as slack, Zendesk, Github or/and Google drive both to organize communication (within and outside the project) and disseminate the results of our project.

To participate to this session, prepare a 5-10 mn presentation/hands-on on how you organize communication within/outside your project and come to discuss and share your experience.
