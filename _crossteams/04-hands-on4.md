 DeepDive will show us how they have used machine learning algorithms for 
 identifying and processing sensor-based data.
 
 The reason for this choice is that there are several countries working on this subject and consider it of strategic importance. At the same time we expect that this would be an interesting topic for the other NeIC networks and there may be some synergies that could be explored with these groups.
