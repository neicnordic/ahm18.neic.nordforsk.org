All NeIC projects need to organize both their internal and external communication. Some of us use tools such as slack, Zendesk, Github or/and Google drive both to organize communication (within and outside the project) and disseminate the results of our project.

Give your inputs by completing [this survey](https://skjema.uio.no/ahmcrossteam4) (attendance to fill the survey is not mandatory) and come to share your experience and help us to establish best practices!
