<h3> How to set up the very best event</h3>

<h4>Goals</h4>

Your first impression determines the rest of your day.....entering a venue with an open mindset and the good feeling of someone has made the effort of welcoming you...
<br> 
<p>
 Each event or training hereafter 'conference' is different, as it should be. However, there are some general principles that apply to all types of activities that you should have in mind the next time you arrange an event.
 </p> 
 <p>
  Conferences are one of the most difficult events you can arrange. Whether your guests are creative geniuses, demanding business people or dressed superheroes, they have all the high expectations of the conference and a coffee bar that is not going to extinguish. Of course, you can not do it all by yourself, so please delegate the tasks and responsibilities, and spend time and energy planning each and every detail to make your conference memorable for all the participants.

  <br>
  <ol>
   <li> Carefully select the location of your conference 
   Your choice of location may determine whether the event will be a hit. Find the right balance between the location quality and how easy it is for your guests to reach there. Perhaps you want to give a "reward" to those guests who appear on time? It may also be a good idea to arrange transport options to and from the event if the budget allows. Think about whether there will be room for all your guests, whether the location will suit your theme and whether there is all the facilities  you need to hold the desired event. (like smaller rooms for group work etc.)
   </li>
    
    <li> Schedule detailed budgets
    The figures in your budget must not be pure speculation. To start with when planning your conference, you can estimate how many participants you should expect to collect food, drink and to determine your cost per person/participant. However, once you've received the registrations, look at the numbers again and see if they need to be adjusted so you're sure your expected revenue and expenses will fit your budget. Always remember to get all offers, contracts and conditions in writing.
   </li>
     
     <li>Become a master of time management
     When you arrange a conference you will be the first person to meet up and the last person leaving the room so that time management during each and every part of the planning and execution of your event is necessary. Do not let your guests stand up and wait, you need to add a little buffer for unexpected situations.
   </li>

     <li>Be sensible in your choice of food and drink
     Master of details like everything else in your conference planning, when ensuring the catering of your event? Perhaps you should ask your guests if they have specific preferences or food allergies. And bare in mind, we are spending tax payers money, you should make sure it is fair and we get value for money.
   </li>
      
      <li> Have a strong plan + a team you can trust
      A division of tasks is essential for any event and there is always a helping hand. Even if it's just a small mess, rather be safe than sorry, you could be excused and a backup should be ready. Keep in mind that when you arrange an event, it is the time of the participants that counts. No waiting time or constraints are vital to succeed with your conference.
