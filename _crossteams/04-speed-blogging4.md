An inspiring example of how this can work is the community of research software engineers (RSEs) in the UK. What will it take to build a RSE-like community in the Nordics? What are the challenges in creating a community over Nordic borders? What role can NeIC play in this endeavour?

Some of us are dreaming about it... Can we make it happen? 

Come and help us to shape the future of the Nordic community of scientific software developers!
