The goal of this session is to present recent developments in provision and consumption of cloud services in Nordic countries. Examples will be presented from the NeIC projects Glenna2 (https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Glenna2) and DeepDive (https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Biodiversity). The session will include an introduction to cloud-based research infrastructure, presentation of examples and live demonstrations of cloud services, followed by a discussion of potential collaborations across NeIC projects.


If you’re interested to discuss how biodiversity services are federated on the cloud you can sign up on the following platforms prior to the meeting (www.biodiversitycatalogue.org/, https://portal.biovel.eu/) 

Attendees will be able to
·      understand the opportunities and challenges related to the use of cloud services
·      discuss how cloud services can be used in their own scientific field
·      identify potential added value that can be obtained through use of cloud services across different NeIC programs
