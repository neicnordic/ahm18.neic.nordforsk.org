<h3> How to best organize communication within and outside our project</h3>
Organized by <b>[Anne Fouilloux](mailto:annefou@geo.uio.no)</b> and <b>[Maiken Pedersen](mailto:maiken.pedersen@usit.uio.no)</b>.<br><br>


All NeIC projects need to organize both their internal and external communication. Most of us use tools such as slack, Zendesk, Github or/and Google drive both to organize communication within and outside the project and disseminate the results of our project.

Give your inputs by completing [**this survey**](https://skjema.uio.no/ahmcrossteam4) (filling the survey does not require attendance, but is very useful for us anyway) and come to share your experience and help us to establish best practices!

<h4>Goals</h4>

The goal of this session is to share your experience on how you organize communication within/outside your project and learn about other NeiC project.  

<h4>Practical information</h4>

- Length of the session: 15:45-17:00
- Requirements: fill the [pre-crossteam questionnaire](https://skjema.uio.no/ahmcrossteam4)
- Operation: a quick review of the pre-crossteam questionnaire results will be given and working groups (depending on the number of participants) will work together to establish good practices for efficient internal and external communications.

<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>

- Get an overview of existing practices within NeIC
