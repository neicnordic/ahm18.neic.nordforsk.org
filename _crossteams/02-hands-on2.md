We will showcase how CodeRefinery uses Slack and Typeform. Slack is the communication tool used across all of NeIC, but the usage pattern of Slack within CodeRefinery differs from most other Slack channels (including #general, #web etc.) in that threading is used without exception.
This means that all discussions on a single topic, initiated by a comment in the #coderefinery
channel, must take place within a thread.
As a hands-on exercise we will create two temporary slack channels and two groups of
participants. One group discusses 3 topics in an unthreaded channel, the other group 3 topics in
a threaded channel - we instruct participants to simulate interrupted work and actually
encourage them to also check their emails or whatever during the exercise. After some time
groups switch channels and try to comment on the discussion topics which will require some
catching up. Finally we discuss our impressions from this exercise.
CodeRefinery uses Typeform for workshop registrations as well as workshop follow-up surveys.
It is very valuable to get background information from registered workshop participants in order
to customize workshop content. Typeform is a useful tool to create visually appealing
questionnaires with a range of different question types, and the results from a questionnaire can
easily be disseminated and analyzed.
As a hands-on exercise, we will set up a typeform with various types of questions (multiple
choice, scale, free-form, etc), an automatic reply option and automatic notification after each
registration. All participants will be asked to fill the form, and we analyze the result together.
