CodeRefinery will show how they use slack, Zendesk, Github and Google drive to organize communication (within and outside the project) and disseminate the results of their project.

Slack is the communication tool used across all of NeIC, but the usage pattern of Slack within CodeRefinery differs from most other Slack channels (including #general, #web etc.) in that threading is used without exception.
This means that all discussions on a single topic, initiated by a comment in the #coderefinery channel, must take place within a thread.

As a hands-on exercise we will create two temporary slack channels and two groups of participants. One group discusses 3 topics in an unthreaded channel, the other group 3 topics in a threaded channel - we instruct participants to simulate interrupted work and actually
encourage them to also check their emails or whatever during the exercise. After some time groups switch channels and try to comment on the discussion topics which will require some catching up. 

Finally we discuss our impressions from this exercise.
