<h4>Goals</h4>

The goal of this session is to share experience and find synergies between several NeIC projects about distributing and sharing data (large datasets). For example, the NT1 project (LHC experiments) will share its experience in managing and distributing large datasets and the NICEST project will show how to use ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation) collaborative environment to support distributed, complex, multi-part projects data sharing.

And what about your project? Any experience with data publishing, sharing, archiving? Come and share your experience!
