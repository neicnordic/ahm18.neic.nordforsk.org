                                </ul>

      The following guidance is given to help you for this session:
	  <ul>
        <li>Take about 1 hour to discuss about the topic chosen in your team.</li>
        <li> Write a short blog on your findings during the rest of the session: choose one or two pictures and write a few paragraphs</li>
        <li> Keep about 10 minutes before the end of the session to choose who will present your findings during the wrap-up session on Wednesday morning, and prepare a 2-3 minutes presentation for this.</li>
